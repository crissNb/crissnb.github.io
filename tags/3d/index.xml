      <description>This project is based on: http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/ Couple days ago, I came across this interesting article called &amp;ldquo;Polygonal Map Generation for Games&amp;rdquo;. At first glance, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely interested, as I mostly generate my terrain using perlin noise. This is a much easier implementation - Unity&amp;rsquo;s Math library officially supports perlin noise, making it easier for Unity users to implement perlin noise based terrains. However, the maps generated by perlin noise aren&amp;rsquo;t entirely good for creating island maps.</description>

      <description>This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a quick and short research on mesh simplification algorithm (and homogeneous coordiantes, quadrics) using quadric error metrics (and planning on implementing this algorithm with Unity Engine). Be aware that not all of this information may be correct.
Homogeneous coordinates (projective coordinates) railroad; source: https://www.songho.ca/math/homogeneous/homogeneous.html In contrast to Euclidean geometry (three-dimensional space), projective geometry introduces another Z dimension, called W, in which it is used to describe the distance from the projector to the screen.</description>

One Room Survival is a game that I started making after I published Sketch Hero. After careful consideration, I decided to make a PC game. Possibly also port it to Android, if the impressions of the game are good. Something that I had to consider while planning the project was marketing. In the beginning, I also had no idea where to exactly publish my game. Steam, a huge game &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo;, which is commonly used by most of the gamers, was not an option for me personally, as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for the fee that&amp;rsquo;s required for me to publish the game on Steam.</description>

      <description>&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;DISCONTINUED&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;
Keep in mind I&amp;rsquo;m writing this a year after I stopped making this game. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with portfolio or whatsoever back then.
Awaken Sentinel is the first game that I started making seriously on Unity game engine. It&amp;rsquo;s a multiplier FPS with open-world aspects. I can&amp;rsquo;t provide any further information to the game, nor the story, as the whole project started just because I wanted to learn something and I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on publishing at all/have the finished product.</description>
