      <description>For only 5 days, I worked on an entry for &amp;ldquo;Dani&amp;rsquo;s basement Jam&amp;rdquo; (https://itch.io/jam/danis-discord-server-jam) . Total 93 entries were made to this game jam and 711 ratings in total. This game jam is hosted by a YouTuber called Dani. As he didn&amp;rsquo;t publicly announce this game jam on his YouTube channel, there weren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of participants. I used Unity game engine to make Scattered. For pixel arts and animations, I used Piskel.</description>

      <description>For the past two weeks, I worked on an entry for &amp;ldquo;Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2&amp;rdquo; (https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4) . This is a bigger game jam that&amp;rsquo;s hosted by a YouTuber named &amp;ldquo;Brackeys&amp;rdquo;. I used Unity game engine to make a game in two weeks based on an announced theme, &amp;ldquo;Rewind&amp;rdquo;. The following YouTube video explains how the submission went: </description>

      <description>For the past two weeks, I worked on an entry for &amp;ldquo;I Can&amp;rsquo;t Draw But Want To Make A Game&amp;rdquo; game jam. This game jam mainly targets people who want to make a game and submit it to the game jam, but don&amp;rsquo;t have good ability to draw. I decided to join this game jam, as I myself isn&amp;rsquo;t a good artist and I just found this game jam to be interesting.</description>

      <description>Progression is an Android game made with Unity that I recently released on Google Play store (that is still downloadable on Google play, link to the download at the bottom). It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me a long time for me to develop this game as the whole system was very easy to implement. The main point of this development was to make a simple game in a short duration just so I can get more motivated and get the Unity development wheels rolling again, as I took a break after finishing Sketch Hero.</description>

Sketch Hero is my first Unity Android game project that I published to Google Play store which I worked for around a year.

I spent a lot of time developing this game and I&amp;rsquo;m really satisfied with how it turned out. I made this game to see how well I know about Unity. Sketch Hero is an endless runner, which means the player plays the game endlessly while trying to achieve the highest score possible.</description>
